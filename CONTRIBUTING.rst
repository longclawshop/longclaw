Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and for PyPy. Check 
   https://travis-ci.org/JamesRamm/longclaw/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
