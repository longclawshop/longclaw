# Frontend libraries for Longclaw

This library contains a javascript client for the [Longclaw e-commerce library](client.md).

There are two options for using this library:

1. Install with npm \(`npm i longclawclient --save`\) and then use as you would any other es6+ module \(i.e. as part of a webpack or similar workflow\)
2. Use the built distribution in HTML/browser scripts by loading it with the templatetags provided with Longclaw. The api library will be exposed as a global object named `longclawclient`
