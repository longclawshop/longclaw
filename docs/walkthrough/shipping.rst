Configuring Shipping
====================

Now we can display products and add them to the basket, we must configure our shipping rates
before setting up the checkout process.


Per Country Rates
------------------

Shipping rates are set on a per-country basis via the ``Shipping`` page in the wagtail admin. 
Initially, no countries will be available - Longclaw comes with a set of country data which can be loaded into the database
using the ``loadcountries`` command:

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    python manage.py loadcountries


In the image below, we set a standard rate for the UK. It is possible to select multiple countries
for a rate to apply to. We can also create more than one shipping rate for the same country.

Default Shipping Rate
---------------------

We can configure a default shipping rate to apply to all countries we have not explicitly specified. 

.. note:: By enabling default shipping, you imply that you ship to *all* countries. If you do not wish this
  you should *not* enable default shipping. 

To enable default shipping:

- Select ``settings`` from the wagtail admin menu
- Select ``Longclaw Settings``
- Fill in ``Default Shipping Rate`` and ``Default Shipping Carrier``
- Ensure ``Enable Default Shipping`` is checked.

Currency
********

You can also define the currency in ``Longclaw Settings``. This applies site wide. It is mostly semantic -
Longclaw assumes all calculations & prices are in the same currency - however some payment gateways require the 
currency to be specified.
