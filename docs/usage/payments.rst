Payment Backends
==================

Longclaw supports payment capture through Stripe, Braintree and Paypal (Using the Braintree VZero SDK).

To select the payment gateway to use, you must specify the ``PAYMENT_GATEWAY`` attribute in your ``settings.py``.

The options are:

- ``longclaw.checkout.gateways.base.BasePayment``. A do-nothing base implementation
- ``longclaw.checkout.gateways.stripe.StripePayment``. Capture payments using Stripe.
- ``longclaw.checkout.gateways.braintree.BraintreePayment``. Capture payments using Braintree.
- ``longclaw.checkout.gateways.braintree.PaypalVZeroPayment``. Capture Paypal payments using the braintree v.zero SDK.


Additional Settings and dependencies
------------------------------------

To use payment gateways it is necessary to specify API keys and install client SDK's for the chosen payment provider.

:Stripe:
  ``STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE`` - Your public api key
  ``STRIPE_SECRET`` - Your secret api key
  You will need to install the stripe python sdk (``pip install stripe``)

:Braintree:
  ``BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID`` - Your braintree merchant account ID.
  ``BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY`` - Your public api key
  ``BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY`` - Your secret api key

:Paypal:
  ``VZERO_ACCESS_TOKEN`` - Your access token for the v.zero SDK.

Paypal and braintree require the braintree python SDK (``pip install braintree``)

Custom Integrations
===================

To implement your own payment integration, you must implement the payment gateway interface. This is simple:

- Inherit from ``longclaw.checkout.gateways.base.BasePayment``
- Implement ``create_payment``. This should take a ``request`` object, an ``amount`` and optionally a ``description``. 
  It should use these to capture the payment using your chosen provider. For examples see the implementations in
  ``longclaw.checkout.gateways``
- Implement the ``get_token`` method. This method should generate tokens used by the payment provider. It accepts a ``request``
  object containing post data (``request.data``). Tokens returned may represent different things depending on the 
  payment provider - e.g. it may be used to tokenize payment details or generate authentication tokens.

You can define your own requirements for the request data to be submitted to the functions.
``create_payment`` is called in a POST request to the ``checkout/`` api. ``get_token`` is similarly called 
in a POST request to the ``checkout/token/`` api.

Longclaw aims to be as minimal as possible in order to get the job done. This is why longclaw currently only offers the barest minimum
support necessary to directly create payments with the backend payment provider.
